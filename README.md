# Seabourne Nxus Project Boilerplate

**Current as of 01/29/18**

A repo containing the basic boilerplate configuration and conventions for a Seabourne Nxus project.

Goal is to put the incantations in a common place we can find them later, especially when creating new projects.

Everything of importance is in the `modules/example` folder, including:

* Basic module structure
* Working route tests
* Clientjs config for polymer and arbitrary js

All dependencies are the latest.

If you are reading this and is past June 2018 - PLEASE UPDATE WITH LATEST DEPENDECIES/CONVENTIONS.
